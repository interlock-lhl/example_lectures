# Paradims

- Functional
 - callbacks
 - closures
- Object Oriented Programing
 - represent entities involved in code
 - grouping of data and functionality
 - can be layered with 'inheritance' to extend existing classes

# properties

- own properties
- enumerable vs none enumerable properties
- Object.keys, Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty

# prototypes

- setPrototypeOf
- chain and lookup
- getPrototypeOf

# constructors

- constructor functions
- new keyword
- inheritance via prototype
- instanceof
- constuctor properties

# Classes and Instances

- Classes are light blueprints
- Instances are constructed from the blueprint "constructor" function
- By convention, classes start with a Capital letter
- `new` is the keyword we use to take a Class and make an instance
 - can also do it in a functional way with Object.create();
- `__proto__`
- messing with `.prototype` on built-in classes
- prototypes hold instance methods
